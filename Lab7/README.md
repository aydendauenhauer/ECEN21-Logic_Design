This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 21, where I designed a reaction-time game in Verilog using paired 3-bit up/down counters that run on the same clock and generate win or lose signals when a “stop” input is asserted, based on whether the counter values match. The design includes separate counter, control, and win/lose modules integrated and simulated in Quartus, along with the post-lab documentation.
