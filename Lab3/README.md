This repository contains my Lab 3 project report for ECEN 21, where I designed a combinational traffic-light controller using Sum-of-Products logic derived from Karnaugh maps and implemented with AND, OR, and NOT gates in Quartus. The circuit maps switch inputs to three lane indicator LEDs (carpool, left, and right), and the lab explores both the base controller behavior and extensions such as a timer input and an error output for invalid green-light combinations.
