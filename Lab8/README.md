This repository contains my Lab 8 project for ECEN 21, where I designed a Moore finite state machine vending machine in Verilog that accepts nickels and dimes, tracks the total value with encoded states, and asserts outputs to open the gate and give change once 15 cents or more is reached. The project includes two FSM implementations (equation-based and case-statement style), a Verilog testbench, timing simulations, and the post-lab report.
